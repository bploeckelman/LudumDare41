# Game:
---

Here's the general flow of the game:

- A classic game of Mini Golf, but with tanks... and turrets... and catapults... and maybe one really big tank.
- Get the ball in the hole to complete the level.
- Aim with the mouse cursor and left click to charge fire the ball.
- Each death, including resets, counts as 2 shots.
- Enemy turrets will only fire in a set direction.  Catapults, on the other hand, will aim and attack when you are in sight.
- ** You can't move when you have the ball**, so timing is crucial.
- Pick up powerful power-ups to assist you in your relaxing time on the greens.
